This is a simple batch script and powershell script that work together to email a user when their internet has come back up.

It's a pretty useless script, but is helpful when you have a spotty internet connection. I mainly wrote this due to my internet dropping frequently. 

As stated in `email.ps1` use a dummy email to send emails as using SMTP commands through powershell requires you to lower the security on your email.
